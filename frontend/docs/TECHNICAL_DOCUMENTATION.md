# üõ†Ô∏è Mirage Media Player - Technical Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the Mirage Media Player, a full-stack media streaming platform designed to surpass existing solutions with its modern architecture, advanced features, and superior user experience. It covers the system architecture, frontend and backend implementation details, API documentation, and deployment guidelines.

## 2. System Architecture

The Mirage Media Player is built on a modern, decoupled architecture with a React frontend and a Node.js backend. This separation of concerns allows for independent development, scaling, and maintenance of the two components.

### 2.1. Frontend Architecture

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Radix UI components
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **API Communication**: Axios

### 2.2. Backend Architecture

- **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Media Storage**: Cloudinary
- **File Uploads**: Multer

## 3. Frontend Implementation

### 3.1. Project Structure

The frontend is organized into a modular structure to promote code reusability and maintainability:

- `src/components`: Reusable React components
- `src/contexts`: React Context providers for state management
- `src/hooks`: Custom React hooks for business logic
- `src/pages`: Page-level components
- `src/services`: API integration services
- `src/types`: TypeScript type definitions

### 3.2. Key Components

- **AdvancedPlayer**: The core media player component with advanced controls, waveform visualization, and keyboard shortcuts.
- **AdvancedUpload**: A sophisticated file upload component with drag-and-drop, metadata editing, and progress tracking.
- **useAuth**: A custom hook for managing user authentication and session state.

## 4. Backend Implementation

### 4.1. Project Structure

The backend follows a standard MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

- `models`: Mongoose schemas for database models
- `controllers`: Route handlers for API endpoints
- `routes`: API route definitions
- `middleware`: Custom middleware for authentication, error handling, etc.
- `config`: Configuration files for Cloudinary, etc.

### 4.2. API Endpoints

The backend exposes a comprehensive RESTful API for managing users, media, and playlists. See the README.md file for a detailed list of endpoints.

## 5. Deployment

### 5.1. Frontend Deployment

The frontend can be deployed to any static hosting provider like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3. The `npm run build` command generates a production-ready build in the `dist` directory.

### 5.2. Backend Deployment

The backend can be deployed to any platform that supports Node.js, such as Heroku, AWS EC2, or DigitalOcean. It can also be containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scaling.

## 6. Conclusion

The Mirage Media Player is a powerful and modern media streaming platform that offers a superior user experience and advanced features. Its modular architecture and use of modern technologies make it a scalable and maintainable solution for any media streaming needs.
